# Telegram UbiquiBot

This project allows you to deploy a Telegram`X`ChatGPT auto bounty issue creator using Cloudflare Workers and wrangler.

## Getting Started

2. Install dependencies:

If you are using `yarn`:

```bash
cd telegram-auto-bounty-worker
yarn

- Copy the `environment.example.json` file and rename it to `environment.json`.

- Fill in the required data in the environment.json file.

- After filling in the data, run the setup key command:
